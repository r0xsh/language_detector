# Statistical Language Detector

Very naive and simple statistical language detector in Elixir using [[Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), letters frequencies, words frequencies and [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram).

## TODO

- ~[ ] Try another approach using k-nearest neighbors algorithm~
- [x] Compile language profiles into `[language].profile` files

## Usage

```bash
elixir language_detector.exs
```

## Sample Data
You can get sample data from: https://tatoeba.org
